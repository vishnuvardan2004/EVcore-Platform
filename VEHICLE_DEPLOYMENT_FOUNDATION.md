   - ✅ Status management (available, deployed, maintenance, charging, out_of_service)
   - ✅ Battery health & maintenance tracking
   - ✅ Hub-based location management
   - ✅ Auto-generated Vehicle IDs (EVZ_VEH_XXX format)
   - ✅ Status transition validation
   - ✅ Built-in utility methods

2. **Deployment.js** - Comprehensive deployment tracking
   - ✅ 20+ deployment properties (timing, route, status, real-time data)
   - ✅ Vehicle-pilot assignment with validation
   - ✅ Real-time location & battery tracking
   - ✅ Auto-generated Deployment IDs (DEP_XXX_YYMMDD format)
   - ✅ Status workflow management
   - ✅ Financial tracking (cost, fuel savings)
   - ✅ Business rule validation (no overlaps, pilot availability)

3. **DeploymentHistory.js** - Advanced tracking & analytics
   - ✅ Complete audit trail for deployments
   - ✅ Real-time location history with GPS coordinates
   - ✅ Performance metrics calculation (distance, speed, efficiency)
   - ✅ Incident reporting & management
   - ✅ Communication logs
   - ✅ Data quality monitoring

4. **VehicleMaintenanceLog.js** - Maintenance management
   - ✅ 30+ maintenance properties (scheduling, parts, costs, quality)
   - ✅ Service provider management
   - ✅ Parts replacement tracking
   - ✅ Quality assurance workflow
   - ✅ Auto-generated Maintenance IDs (MAINT_YYMMDD_XXX format)
   - ✅ Warranty & diagnostic tracking

### **📊 Database Infrastructure**

- ✅ **Performance Indexes**: 25+ optimized indexes across all models
- ✅ **Compound Indexes**: Multi-field indexes for complex queries
- ✅ **Unique Constraints**: Auto-generated IDs with collision prevention
- ✅ **Data Validation**: Comprehensive field validation with custom messages
- ✅ **Migration System**: Professional migration runner with rollback support

### **🔧 Utility & Migration Tools**

1. **VehicleDeploymentMigration.js** - Professional migration class
   - ✅ Database structure setup
   - ✅ Index creation & optimization  
   - ✅ Model validation testing
   - ✅ Status reporting
   - ✅ Rollback capabilities

2. **migrate-vehicle-deployment.js** - CLI migration runner
   - ✅ Command-line interface (migrate/rollback/status)
   - ✅ MongoDB connection management
   - ✅ Error handling & logging
   - ✅ Progress reporting

3. **vehicleDeploymentModels.js** - Centralized exports
   - ✅ Clean model importing
   - ✅ Individual & bulk exports

### **📦 NPM Integration**

- ✅ **migrate:vehicle-deployment** - Run migration
- ✅ **migrate:vehicle-deployment:rollback** - Remove all data (dev only)  
- ✅ **migrate:vehicle-deployment:status** - Check current status
